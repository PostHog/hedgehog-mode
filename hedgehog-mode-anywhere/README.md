# Hedgehog Mode Anywhere 🦔

Bring [PostHog](https://posthog.com)'s beloved hedgehog mascot to any website! An adorable animated companion that walks, jumps, and keeps you company while you browse.

Powered by PostHog's official [`@posthog/hedgehog-mode`](https://github.com/PostHog/hedgehog-mode) engine, with pixi.js rendering and matter-js physics.

## 🛠️ Build

This extension lives in the [`hedgehog-mode`](https://github.com/PostHog/hedgehog-mode) monorepo and bundles the local [`@posthog/hedgehog-mode`](https://github.com/PostHog/hedgehog-mode) engine (wired up as `workspace:*`), so the two are built and tested together. Build from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build       # builds the engine, the playground, then this extension
```

Or build just the extension — the engine's `dist/` has to exist first, which `pnpm build` or `pnpm dev` at the root produces:

```bash
pnpm --dir hedgehog-mode-anywhere build
```

This produces `dist/content.js`, `dist/popup.js`, and copies the hedgehog spritesheet into `assets/`. Use `pnpm --dir hedgehog-mode-anywhere watch` to rebuild on change while developing.

> The bundled `@posthog/hedgehog-mode` must keep pixi.js externalized ([PostHog/hedgehog-mode#30](https://github.com/PostHog/hedgehog-mode/pull/30)). Builds that inline pixi.js use a `new Function` shader path that MV3 content scripts forbid and that the extension can't patch. With pixi external, `src/content.jsx` patches the single shared pixi.js for eval-free shaders and main-thread texture loading, so the hedgehog runs on any page even under a strict Content-Security-Policy.
